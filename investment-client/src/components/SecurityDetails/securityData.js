    question: "Password Safety",
    answer:
      "When threat actors hack into a website, passwords are usually the first thing they target. We encourage users to use strong and unique passwords that are not shared anywhere else. We protect user passwords in a variety of ways, storing them in a format called a 'bcrypt hash.' This is a method for protecting your password in our systems.",

  {
    question: "Two-Factor Authentication",
    answer:
      "Two-factor authentication strengthens the security of your account. Typically when you log in to a website, you just need your password. Your password is acting as the first factor in place in order to access your account. With twofactor authentication , you will use your password, and also enter a one-time code from a mobile authenticator application in order to finish logging in. The code is now the second factor in place for account access. Two-factor authentication strengthens the security of your account. Even if an attacker knows your password, they still would not be able to log in unless they also had access to the device where you receive the one-time code. While this adds little friction for legitimate customers, it frustrates attackers. We'll even remember which devices you've logged in with in the past, so that you don't have to keep entering codes when you log in repeatedly with the same device.",

    question: "Encryption",
    answer:
      "Encryption is a control that can help to protect the confidentiality of data. We use several types of encryption (when data is in transit, and when we store it); the specific encryption mechanisms vary, depending on the type of data and where we process it. The information we encrypt includes your financial information, such as your personal information for KYC. Even before you log in to your account, the connection between your web browser and our platform has been encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS helps to ensure privacy for all communications between your computer and our servers. Because of TLS, you can feel confident that any information sent between you and us is kept private as it makes its way through the internet. We also use encryption when storing your personal information. The information we encrypt includes your financial information, such as Digital wallet address.",
